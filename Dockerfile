# create volume
# This VOLUME instruction 
# automatically creates a volume 
# when container is created from the image 
# using docker the -- $ run <image> -- command. 
# The Mountpoint of the volume created by the VOLUME instruction 
# will be -- shared -- 
# as with the specified directory -- /app/shared --.
VOLUME [ "/app/shared" ]

# Apart from specifying a volume with the VOLUME instruction in the Dockerfile, 
# a volume can also be created and mounted on the fly 
# using the -v (short for --volume) or the --mount flag 
# with the -- $ docker run -- command. 
# The --mount flag is more powerful and verbose than -v.
# For simplicity the -v flag is used:
# 
# $ docker run -v <vol>:<dest>:<options> <image>
# 
# Here the <vol> value specifies the volume name to be used. 
# If this volume does not exist, Docker will create it 
# with the given name. 
# If this value is omitted, including :, 
# Docker will create an anonymous volume, 
# which will be shared with <dest>. 
# 
# A host volume can also be mounted 
# by specifying a directory path on the hostâ€™s filesystem.
# The <dest> value specifies an absolute path 
# to the directory of the container's filesystem 
# where the volume would be mounted. 
# If this <dest> directory does not exist, 
# it will be created in the container.

# set entrypoint
# The ENTRYPOINT instruction 
# sets the default command for the container
# when the docker command -- $ run <image> -- 
# is run.
# 
# ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"] < exec  - form
# ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2              < shell - form: executes the command using /bin/sh -c
# 
ENTRYPOINT [ "./bin/avatar" ]

# set default arguments
# 
# The CMD instruction, 
# if ENTRYPOINT is present in the Dockerfile, 
# will act as default arguments 
# for the command represented by the ENTRYPOINT. 
# Therefore, the final ENTRYPOINT command 
# in the setting above would be :
# 
# -- $ executable param1 param2 param3 param4 --
# 
# But, these parameters can be overwrittem 
# by providing arguments in the docker command
# 
# -- $ run <image> param33 param44 --
# 
# CMD [ "param3", "param4" ]
# 
# CMD [ "./test.png", "./shared/test_out.jpg" ]
# CMD [ "./tmp/src/external-content.png", "./shared/test_out.jpg" ]
CMD [ "./external-content.png", "./shared/external-content.png" ]
